    "To work constructively with any dataset, one needs to create an ingestion profile to make sure that the data at the source can be readily consumed. For this section of the predict, as the Data Engineer in the team, you will be required to design and implement the ingestion process. For the purposes of the project the AWS cloud storage service, namely, the S3 bucket service will act as your data source. All the data required can be found [here](https://processing-big-data-predict-stocks-data.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/stocks.zip).\n",
